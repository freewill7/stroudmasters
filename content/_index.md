Stroud Masters is a swimming club for anyone 18 or over in the Stroud area... although if youâ€™re 18 or over and regularly in the area youâ€™re just as welcome to join us too.

Todayâ€™s club formed in 2006, but we can trace our roots back to at least 1905 (see our [history](/about/history) page).

We believe in equality, equity and respect, irrespective of any difference in age, sexual orientation, gender, faith, ethnic origin, nationality, or any other grounds.   And youâ€™ll soon see that we come in all shapes and sizes.  If you canâ€™t see a likeness in our photos, itâ€™s not because you are not welcome, it just that you havenâ€™t joined us yet ðŸ˜Š.

We participate in swimming (pools and open water).  Some of our sessions are coach led, and others are facilitated by one of a small group of our fantastic members.  If youâ€™d like, you may even be able to join some of our members who enjoy competing in events â€“ and the aprÃ¨s swim that goes with it â€“ that take place all over the world e.g. Fina World Championships, and the World Transplant Games. 

Whether you are looking to swim socially, youâ€™re starting out, returning from a long break e.g. due to work/family commitments, or fancy your hand at competition â€“ local or further afield â€“ [weâ€™ve something for you](/about).  

We think of ourselves as the small friendly club with a big presence.  We try to cater for everyone and are always looking to improve.  So, if you want to get wet, get active, and meet new friends, come, and say â€˜hiâ€™.  Oh, and as the first swim is on us (a kind of â€˜try before you buyâ€™) what have you got to lose?
