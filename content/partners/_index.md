The clinic offers hands-on Physiotherapy with techniques including joint mobilisations and manipulation, soft tissue massage, acupuncture, exercises with strength and conditioning, gait (walking & running) analysis and work place assessments.

Weâ€™re currently offering a 10% discount for members of Stroud Masters, so why suffer that sore shoulder?! To book an appointment, please either call our reception on 01453 755948
