Mark and Jessica got the meet off to a flying start taking golds in the 100m butterfly. Mark took a second gold in the butterfly sprint and silver medals in his other two events. Jessica followed suit with a gold in the butterfly sprint then achieved silver and bronze in her other two events. Will found himself in a highly competitive age group, but took gold in his favored 100m backstroke event. Well done to all !
