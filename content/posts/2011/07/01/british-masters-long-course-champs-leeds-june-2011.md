Stroud Masters swimmers Jessica Wooddisse, Mark Partridge and Scott Nelson had a very successful trip to the British Masters Long Course Swimming Championships held at Leeds recently.

Jessica made a great start to the three day competition by winning a gold medal in the 1500m on the first day and only missed out on breaking the nineteen minute barrier by just over a second. This was the first of three gold medals won by Jessica during the competition, the others being achieved in the 400m and 800m freestyle events, both again swum in personal best times. Jessica also came away with silver in the 400m Individual Medley. Mark swam well over the weekend to achieve his best ever position in a national swimming event by gaining fourth position in the 50m breaststroke and a new personal best time. As well as the fourth spot Mark also came away with a fifth place in the 800m freestyle as well as two sixth places in the 50m breaststroke and 100m breaststroke. New recruit Scott Nelson put in good performances to gain eighth in both the 50m breaststroke and 100m freestyle events. Club swimmers are now concentrating on open water events during the summer with the Gloucestershire County Open Water Championships taking place at Henleaze Lake in Bristol in July, as well as the ASA National Open Water Championships for Masters in Sheffield later in the same month.
