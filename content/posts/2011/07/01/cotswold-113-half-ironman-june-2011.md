Stroud Masters swimmers, Lewis Saunders, (50-54yrs), and Richard Searle (45-49yrs), took part in the inaugural Cotswold 113 Middle Distance Triathlon, a distance more commonly referred to as either Half Ironman or a 70.3 after the total distance entrants complete in miles.

The 360 competitors started to arrive for the event at the un-earthy hour of 3.45am in readiness for the prompt 6am mass start.

The event, which took place on Sunday 26th June was held in and around the Cotswold Water Park and consisted of a gruelling;
- 1.2 mile (1.9km) swim)
- 56 mile (90km) bike
- 13.1 mile (21.1km) run

Since its inception five years ago, Middle Distance has become the fastest growing triathlon series in the world, with the distance not only requiring competitors to master the 4th discipline of triathlon, the transition, but bringing into play a 5th element, that of nutrition. This requires athletes to maintain their carbohydrate stores whilst out on the bike course so that they are not depleted of energy when they arrive back into transition and then heading off on a ½ marathon and the awaiting finish! Failure to get their nutrition right can result in athletes hitting the wall - and ultimately not finishing the event.

Unfortunately for dedicated swimmers, Middle Distance Triathlon favours strong cyclists, with Middle Distance Triathlon having the swim distance increased by just 26% over an Olympic distance triathlon, whereas the cycle is increased by 225% and the run 200%.

Swim
The 1.2 mile swim consisted of two laps of the Cotswold Water Park Lake 32, which was clearly marked with a number of small dinghies and their highly colourful sails. On the final lap, competitors had to swim around the lakeÃs only island before exiting the water and running the short distance into T1, which was located by the Head 4 Heights activity centre.

Bike
The 56 mile bike course led competitors out on a loop via Down Ampney, skirting south of Marston Meysey, through Kempsford and onto the turn-around point at the top of Nell Hill, Hannington. The competitors then cycled the route in reverse back to Lake 32, before heading back out onto the course for a second lap of the 28 mile circuit.
Run
The 13.1 mile run, difficult at the best of times, comes straight after the 56 mile cycle, so not surprisingly it takes competitors leg muscles a while to get used to their new activity. The course, as show, was three 4.36 mile circuits which consisted largely of hard pack lakeside trails.

Weather
The long-range weather forecast prior to the event had predicted the same grey skies and heavy showers that weÃd endured throughout much of June. However, although the forecast 24 hours before the event had indicated full sun and 28oC temperatures, the morning started with a heavy, almost rain like mist. The sun, thankfully for the competitors not showing itself fully until most were on their second / third lap of the run, at which point the shade offered by the canopy when running through the wooded sections was most welcome.
