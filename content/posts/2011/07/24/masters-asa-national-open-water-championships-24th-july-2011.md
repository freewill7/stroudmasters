The 3km non-wetsuit event, swum around a 1km course, attracted 47 male and female competitors on what turned out to be a sunny but slightly windy day. The water temperature was a balmy 18 degrees centigrade with the headwind providing a bit of a challenge and some choppy conditions as swimmers navigated the 400m finishing straight.

The race was won Matthew Breckon from Loughborough University in 35.06 with the fastest lady being Helen McRoberts from Sheffield finishing third overall in a time of 38.33. The first three swimmers were all from the 19 - 24 years age-group. The main pack of some seven or eight ÃolderÃ swimmers, following hard on the heels of the first three, all finished the distance in the 41 to 42 minute time range. Mark finished in 14th position in a time of 46.40 and much to his surprise won the gold medal for his age-group.
