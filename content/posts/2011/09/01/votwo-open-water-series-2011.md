The team had taken part in two of the previous series races earlier in the year, the first at Bowsmoor Sailing Club near Lechlade and the second, a sea swim, at Bournemouth beach. Going into the final race Jessica was well placed to win the series prize for first female having won both of her two previous races. With the overall series prize determined by a competitorÃs three highest finishes, Sean was is a slightly more uncertain position having won the Bournemouth Swim but only achieving fifth place at Bowsmoor.

The conditions on the day were almost perfect for swimming with sunny weather and little or no wind, although the water was slightly on the cool side. Sean swam a great race to finish in first place overall finishing over a minute ahead of the second place swimmer. Unfortunately though this was not quite enough to give Sean overall series winner, and finished as runner-up. Jessica swam well to finish in fourth place on the day, and as second placed female swimmer. As a result of finishing in second place Jessica also claimed the female series prize and walked away with a top of the range Aquasphere wetsuit. Lorraine improved her time on last year's race by almost seven minutes to finish as third placed senior female. This was a great result for Lorraine and just reward for her many early morning visits to Lake 32 this year - it may also be something to do with the brand new Snug wetsuit she was wearing. Mark also put in a good performance to finish in 11th position overall, his highest finish position of the three races. The steady improvement in his race times over the open water season have made him one to watch for the future!
