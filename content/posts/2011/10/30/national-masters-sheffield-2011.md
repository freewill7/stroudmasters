With over one thousand entrants this annual event is the largest and most competitive MasterÃs pool based swimming event of the year.
The team made a great start to the three day event with both Geoff Twinning and Jessica Wooddisse gaining medals in the 1500m freestyle; Jessica winning gold and Geoff, silver. Later on the same day Mark Partridge swam a new personal best time to win a bronze in the 100m breaststroke. Swimming in a very competitive age-group, Kerrie Aldridge ended the first days swimming with an eleventh place in the 100m backstroke.
Medals continued to be won on the second and third days of the competition with Jessica winning gold in the 400m and 800m freestyle events and a silver in the 400m individual medley. Geoff swam well to win gold in the 400 individual medley with Mark gaining a surprising silver and one second personal best time in the 50m breaststroke. Kerrie put in very creditable performances to get fifth in the 200m backstroke, eighth in the 200m breaststroke and ninth place in a very close 50m backstroke.
The team came back with four gold medals, three silver medals, one bronze and a number of personal best times which was overall a great performance from the small team from Stroud.
