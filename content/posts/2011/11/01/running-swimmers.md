Apologies to several swimmers whose running exploits got sent to me, but were lost in my system. Belatedly, they deserve a wider audience!

 Lewis Saunders in Toronto

Congratulations to all our Members who recently took part in the Stroud Half Marathon last autumn. Those participants that I am aware of are: Gwen Kinsey, Bob Wilson, Mario Macnamara, Debbie Kedge and Simon Offord. All successfully crossed the finishing line.

One swimmer, however, travelled a little further afield to compete in the 26.2 miles Marathon run in Toronto City. Congratulations to Lewis Saunders who completed the course along with 4,000 other competitiors. Lewis finished in 1655th.
