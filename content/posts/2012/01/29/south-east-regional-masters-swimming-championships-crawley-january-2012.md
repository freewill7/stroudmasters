The two day event attracted many of the best swimmers in the region with all events swum long course in the 50m pool. Jessica Wooddisse had a great competition recording personal best times in all of her six events, winning gold medals in two, as well gaining a silver and bronze medal in other events. Geoff Twinning dominated his age group winning three golds out of three events, these all being events which he hopes to swim in the Masters World Swimming Championships later on in the year. Mark Partridge, the third member of the team, also had a good meet recording a couple of personal best times, one in the 800m freestyle which is a non-speciality event for him, and gaining four silvers overall.
