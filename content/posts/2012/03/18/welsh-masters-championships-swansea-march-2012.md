Swimming Championships held at the 50m pool in Swansea. On a weekend when most in South Wales were hoping that the Welsh Rugby team would bring home the Six Nations Championship, the four swimmers from the Club were hoping to put in an equally good performance in the pool and bring back as many top three finishes as possible to Stroud.
Lewis Saunders and Greg Clements were first in the water in the 1500m freestyle event with Greg winning a gold medal in his age-group and Lewis gaining a silver medal in the thirty length race. Jessica Wooddisse was next in the water competing in one of her least favoured events, the 200m breaststroke, where she swam strongly to win a silver medal in a new personal best time. Later in the same day she also completed in the 100m and 200m freestyle events winning silver and gold respectively. Mark Partridge won two golds and one silver medal on the first day of competition setting new personal best times in the 200 freestyle and 200m individual medley. The high-light of the second day swimming was Jessica's performance in the 400m individual medley were she had a great race to finish as second fastest female in the event overall whilst winning a gold medal in her own age-group. Mark completed the day gaining a further two gold medals. Overall the team came away with fourteen medals: eight gold, five silver and one bronze, and numerous personal best times.
