On a very hot and sunny day, the water temperature was just sufficiently warm enough to swim without wetsuits but on this occasion, as it was the first race of the season, everyone in the team elected to swim in wetsuits. With over two hundred swimmers in the race Sean Kinsey put in a good performance to finish in first place, thirty seconds ahead of the second placed swimmer. Similarly, Jessica Wooddisse finished well placed in third overall and as first placed lady. Mark Partridge finished in eleventh overall and second in his age-group behind Sean. Lorraine Savagar the final member of the team, swam well to finish in first place in her age-group and in thirty-fifth place overall.

Earlier in the month Jessica and Mark competed in the National Long Course Masters Swimming Championships at Sheffield. Jessica had a great weekend of swimming coming away with three gold medals in her favoured longer distance freestyle events as well as a silver in the 400m IM and three personal best times. Mark also had a successful weekend coming away with silver in the 50m breaststroke event as well as a number of personal best long course times.
