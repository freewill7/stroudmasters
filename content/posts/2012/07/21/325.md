The first few weeks of July have seen swimmers from Stroud Masters compete in a number of open water competitions.

The 1st July marked the ASA South West Region Open Water Championships at Bradley Stoke where a small team of swimmers tackled the 5km race without the aid of wetsuits. With the water at 17.5 degrees, a gusty wind, limited visibility and ten laps of the course to complete, it was a challenging event. First home was Jessica Wooddisse who won her age group but found herself chasing two junior girls. Seven minutes behind was Mark Partridge who also won his age group, whilst Lewis Saunders received a well earned bronze in his age group in his first attempt at the distance.

The following week a team wearing wetsuits took part in The Big Cotswold Swim at South Cerney. First back in the one mile event was Jon Arnold in 9th place overall and 2nd in his age group. He was closely followed by Lorraine Savagar who overcame a brush with other swimmers and the loss of her goggles at the start to win her age group. Two places behind was Will Lee who improved on his time from the previous year. Richard Long took part in his first open water event of the year to finish 9th in the over forty age-group and was closely followed seconds later by Simon Offord finishing 10th in the same age-group. Nick Bishop, Richard Smith and Lewis Saunders opted for the 2 mile swim with Nick and Richard placing well to finish 21st and 35th out of over 125 swimmers.

On the same weekend three swimmers also took part in the Gloucestershire ASA County Open Water Championships at Henleaze Lake in Bristol. On what turned out to be a glorious afternoon of sunshine, Stroud swimmers dominated the 2km race with Geoff Twinning and Sean Kinsey both swimming as guests finishing in first and second places respectively. Mark Partridge also placed well finishing in 6th place overall and 1st place in his age-group.
