On Tuesday 1st January, Stroud Master's Lorraine Savagar and Richard Searle, together with ten other open water swimmers - and watched by just as many family and friends - saw in 2013 with a swim in Cirencester's Lake 32 (much as they did last year when they saw out 2011).



Some of the twelve simply opted to swim a hundred meters, but Lorraine and Richard choose a longer cold water swim, with Lorraine swimming 750m and Richard 1km in the calm 7oC water.

Once back on the lake's foreshore, and with wetsuits removed, they entered the water for a second time, with Richard having an impromptu 50m race with a fellow swim partner. Afterwards they enjoyed the first sunshine of 2013 whilst changing back into warm clothes.
