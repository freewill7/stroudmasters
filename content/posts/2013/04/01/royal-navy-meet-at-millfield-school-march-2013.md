Three of Stroud Masters' swimmers made the trip to Millfield School in Somerset to compete in the Royal Navy Masters Open Meet.

This annual event is run for charity and attracts swimmers from around the country. Taking away the most medals on the team was Mark Partridge who collected three silvers in his freestyle and butterfly events and a gold in the individual medley. Richard Searle was the busiest swimmer of the day competing in six different events including a 400 metres freestyle. He was rewarded with a bronze, a silver and a gold medal in addition to three fourth placed finishes. Jessica Wooddisse swam two personal best times and took home a gold and two silver medals. The three will be joined by other club members at the next event that will take place closer to home at Gloucester later in April.
