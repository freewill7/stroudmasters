A team of eleven Stroud Masters swimmers recently swam at GL1 in Gloucester in the annual open meet hosted by Gloucester Masters Swimming Club. This year the event attracted a record number of swimmers with all age-groups turning out to be very competitive.


Swimming in their first pool competition for the Club, Danny Baker and Andy Tarr put in great performances with Danny finishing just out of the medals in fourth spot in both of his breaststroke events. Jo Green looked very strong in the 50m and 100m freestyle successfully taking away two silver medals as well as swimming a personal best time in the shorter distance. Jessica Wooddisse and Mark Partridge were rewarded for strong swims in a number of events each achieving two golds, with Mark taking a further silver and Jessica a bronze. Joe Lewis swam well to achieve two silvers from his four events whilst Elaine Lewis and Nikki Gaunt recorded a number of personal best times and took home a silver medal each. Busiest swimmer of the day was Will Lee swimming in five events in which he gained two bronzes. A number of personal best swims were also achieved by Lorraine Savagar and Bob Wilson who achieved three pbs between them.
