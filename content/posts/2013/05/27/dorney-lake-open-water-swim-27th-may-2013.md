The cool waters of Olympic boating lake played host to over one thousand competitors with five events on offer ranging from 750m to 10km. Jessica Wooddisse and Mark Partridge both competed in the 3km race with Wooddisse finishing as first lady and in 5th place overall out of over 300 competitors whilst Partridge finished in a very creditable 13th position. Lorraine Savagar opted to swim in the longer 5km race and swam a great race to finish 31st out of over 200 swimmers.
