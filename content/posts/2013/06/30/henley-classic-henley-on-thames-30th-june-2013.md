Jessica, Lorraine and Mark left Stroud in the early hours of the last day of June to make the 4.30 am start of the Henley Classic, a 2.1 km iconic sunrise swim along one of the most famous and beautiful stretches of the River Thames. With almost eight hundred wet-suited and non suited swimmers taking part this is one of the largest and most popular events of the open water calendar catering for a range of swimming abilities from novice to elite.
Jessica and Mark were first in the water shortly after the start of the elite race, with Jessica finishing first in the Ladies Open Category and Mark fifth in the Men's 45-55 Category. Lorraine continued the team's good form by putting in a great performance to finish in sixth position in her wave. All the team agreed that it had been a unique experience unlike any other event they had previously taken part in.
