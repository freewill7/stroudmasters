Each member of the team competed in the 2000 metre race in which competitors are not permitted to wear wetsuits. Geoff Twinning and Jessica Wooddisse both put in exceptionally strong swims to finish as Mens and Ladies Champions respectively, with Geoff just pipping Bristol based rival Peter Gleed to finish in first place overall. Jessica finished in third place overall and also posted a new county record for her age-group.
In the 45-54 age-group Sean Kinsey finished in first position and fourth place overall, whilst Mark Partridge took second place in the same age-group. Lorraine Savagar also swam well to take third place in her age-group.
To round off a great day of swimming, the team was surprised to find they had finished as the first placed team at the Championships winning most points of any competing Club.
