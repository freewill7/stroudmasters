A team of four Stroud Masters recently took part in the locally organised Tri Ferris open water swim at South Cerney.

Over 100 swimmers took to the water in the 1 mile distance where Lorraine Savagar set a good pace to finish 4th overall and 1st in her age group. She was closely followed by Richard Smith who finished in 5th place, also winning his age group. They were joined by triathlete Simon Offord who took 42nd position. Geoff Twinning opted to swim in the 2 mile event where he took the overall title.
Savagar was joined by Mark Partridge and Jessica Wooddisse in an event over three times the distance at Coombe Reservoir in Derbyshire. She knocked several minutes off her previous best time for the 5km swim to finish 10th overall and 2nd in her age group. Partridge put in a strong performance to win his age group and placed 6th overall. Wooddisse took the overall title.
