Kelly Young a Stroud Master member has just returned from two major sporting events, 19 years on from a life-saving liver transplant that she received at the age of 8 months, on 10 August 1994.

Kelly competed in Durban, South Africa at the World Transplant Games, which ran from July 28 to August 4.  

Representing Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Kelly competed in 5 individual swimming events, and two relays. She returned with five medals: one gold (Ladies IM relay), three silver (50m fly, 50m backstroke, 200m Individual Medley) and one bronze (50m freestyle).

The World Transplant Games are supported by the International Olympic Committee and is regarded as the largest organ donor awareness event in the world with a week of events across 13 sports and over 1,000 athletes from 50 countries across the globe. Around 135 Transplant Sport athletes from Team GB and NI competed in South Africa, along with 15 juniors and 150 supporters. This was the fourth time Kelly has appeared at the World Games, having previously competed in 2007 Bangkok, Thailand, 2009 Gold Coast, Australia and 2011 Gothenburg, Sweden.

Kelly then joined over 650 competitors at the British Transplant Games held in Sheffield from 15 to 18 August. There she achieved 6 gold medals for 5 individual swimming events(50m fly, 50m back, 50m freestyle, 100m freestyle and 200m freestyle) and freestyle relay gold with the Kings College Hospital (London) relay team. At the British Transplant Games you represent the hospital unit at which you received your transplant. Kelly was also awarded the Transplant Sport UK, Best Female Adult' trophy for her age group 18 - 29 years.

The Games are a celebration of life, but also highlight the importance of organ donation, showcasing the difference a transplant can make to people's lives. Kelly hopes that her story will also provide inspiration to others who have had, or are waiting for, a transplant.

More than 10,000 people are currently waiting for a transplant in the UK and three people die waiting every day, yet only 29 per cent of the population are registered as donors.
