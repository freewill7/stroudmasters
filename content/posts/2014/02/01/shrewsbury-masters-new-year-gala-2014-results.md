Stroud Masters swimmers kicked off 2014 with a trip to Shrewsbury in Shropshire. A team of six travelled to compete at the Shrewsbury Masters New Year Gala which unlike the majority of competitions allows swimmers to only enter one event in each of the four strokes from a choice of three distances, and also an individual medley. Swimmers gain points for each event entered which are then added together and result in an overall age group placing.

In the youngest Master's age group Joe Lewis put in a series of strong swims to finish first in four of his individual events and win his age-group title. Competing in the same age group Elaine Lewis gained two second places to finish a very creditable sixth place overall, whilst Nikki Gaunt, swimming in the competition for the first time, finished in third place in her age-group, winning two of her five events. Jessica Wooddisse started the year off by winning four of her five events, and also winning her age-group. Richard Searle won one of his individual events as well as achieving three second places but just failed to place in the top three in his age-group. The final swimmer in the team, Mark Partridge, had an impressive set of swims taking his age group title with five wins out of five swims.
