The team was formed to enable female swimmers who regularly compete at a national level to compete in national relay events where they are lacking a club based team. The other members of the team were Nicola Latty from Oundle, Karen Driver from Colne and Sandy Jones from Gloucester Masters. The team broke the existing records, both previously held by Trafford Metro from Manchester, by ten seconds and finished in a time of 9.33.56.
