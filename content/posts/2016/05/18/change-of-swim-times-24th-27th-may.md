Hello Everyone

Due to the unavailability of lifeguards over the next week or so we have had to cancel a couple of morning sessions and change the timing of next Tuesday evening's session (lifeguards are unavailable because they are away competing in either the European Swimming Champs in London or at the European Tri Champs in Lisbon).

The cancelled morning sessions are Wednesday 25th May and Friday 27th May at Archway.

On Tuesday 24th May the session in the evening at Archway will be half an hour shorter than normal and run from 6.30 to 7.30 pm.

Any questions please don't hesitate to contact me

Mark
