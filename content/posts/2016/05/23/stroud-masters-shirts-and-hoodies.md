Hello Everyone

I've had a few queries recently regarding the purchasing of Club shirts and hoodies. If you represent the Club then a polo shirt and hat are provided by the Club. However if you would like to purchase a shirt (polo or t) or a hoodie then use the link below to see what's available.

You could either place the order yourself via the website or if you let me have details of your order (code, size, etc) plus payment I can then place one larger order from the Club. This would mean that your wouldn't have to pay postage or arrange to collect.

If you want to buy an item could you let me have the details and payment by Sunday 12th June. If there is a colour would you like but can't see (e.g. pink) then I can ask the supplier if it would be possible to supply in that colour.

Hopefully it's all clear, however if you have any queries please don't hesitate to ask. If you would like to buy a Club hat they are available for Â£3.50 (but only available in red I'm afraid),

Thanks

Mark
