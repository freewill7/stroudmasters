As of 1st November Tuesday evening sessions at Archway will be coached by Graham Brookhouse.

Sessions will continue to start at 6:30pm and finish at 8:00pm until Christmas. After Christmas there will be a change to the times and sessions will start at 7:00pm. The committee are considering the options of finishing the session at 8:00pm or keeping a 90 minute session and finishing at 8:30pm. If you have a view on what time you would prefer to finish training please let me know.
