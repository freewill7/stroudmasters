Following the great feedback from members who attended last year's Christmas meal at The Olive Tree, we have booked the same venue for this year. As we did last year, we will have the entire first floor which holds up to 33 - which was perfect last year. If you didn't attend last year, here is a link to the [Olive Tree](http://www.theolivetree-nailsworth.com/)
, it's located in Nailsworth and has ample parking opposite.

Enclosed is the delicious Xmas menu (for any special dietary requirements like Vegan or Gluten Free, there will be additional items to choose from the main menu and we can make those requests nearer the time). For now - please could you let me know by email if you are able to attend and if you will be bringing a guest.

Many thanks

Dot
