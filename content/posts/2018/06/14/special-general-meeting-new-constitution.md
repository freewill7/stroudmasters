Dear All,

The committee has recently updated the Stroud Masters Club Constitution in line with guidelines published by Swim England. However in order for it to become effective the constitution needs to be ratified at a special general meeting. This will take place on Monday 16th July at 18:30 at The Britannia in Nailsworth. All are invited to attend. A copy of the draft constitution is available in the [Documents](/about/)
 section.

Regards

Jessica
