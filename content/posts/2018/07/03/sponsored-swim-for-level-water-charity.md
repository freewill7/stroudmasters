Steve Birch is a fairly recent member who has been swimming with us on a Sunday and Tuesday and is taking part in a sponsored swim for The Level Water Charity.

The Level Water Charity provides free one-to-one swimming lessons for children with disabilities. Without one-to-one disability swimming lessons, most of these children would never learn to swim. Level Water provides one-to-one lessons until each child has learnt to swim 15m frontcrawl and backstroke. From this point, each child is safe and independent in the water.

Steve has challenged himself to swim 6k down a fast flowing river. The event is called the Bantham Swoosh and it takes place on 14th July.

Steve has never swam this kind of distance before and so the event will be a genuine challenge for him. If you want to chip in, Steve would really appreciate it.
