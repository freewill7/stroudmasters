Why not join us for another Pizza Evening on Thursday 27th September 2018... the last pizza evening was a great success.

We also intend to hold the Special General Meeting (SGM), postponed from 16th July, on the same evening... don't panic, its deliberate... as we need as least 7 SMSC members present to be able to vote the new constitution in!  Unless anyone has any concerns over the proposed new constitution (you shouldn't, but if you do please do raise them with a member of the committee beforehand as it'll be a simple Yes/No vote on 27th), the SGM should simply be a 5-minute formality ... then it's pizza and a pint for as long as you like!  
clever plan... uh-huh?

Please let Richard know if you are planning to come so that we can gauge numbers.
