Hello Everyone


You'll be pleased to know that all sessions are on as normal except for the following:




- Christmas Day (Archway 6.30pm) - cancelled

- Boxing Day (Archway 6.30am) - cancelled

- Sunday 30th December (SPLC 7.30am) - cancelled as SPLC doesn't open until 9am.

- New Years Day (Archway 6.30pm) - cancelled


The morning sessions at Archway on Friday 28th and Monday 31st December will start at 7.30am rather than 6.30am so everyone can have a lie in. Any queries let me know,



Mark
