Dear All,

We have been advised by Archway School that Archway pool will be out of action for at least 2 weeks as it needs a new boiler installing. When we have further news on the pool re-opening we will let you know. Sunday morning sessions at Stratford Park will continue as usual.

**Update:**

Just to let you know that the school are confident of having the pool back online by Wednesday 13th March. If these's any change I'll let you know. 

Regards

Jessica
