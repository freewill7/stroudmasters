Hello Everyone

Please find attached the [Club membership form for 2020](/images/2020/01/Membership_Form_2020_v1.pdf).  If you could complete and return to myself or one of the committee members before the end of January together with your membership fee that would be great.  If, however, the Membership Form and Fees are not received by the end of January then it will be assumed you do not wish to renew and your ASA registration will cease.

<!--more-->

It is important that the membership form is fully completed and returned so we can keep our records up-to-date especially if your details or contact details have changed over the last year.

I'm pleased to say that the membership fee remains the same as previous years at £45.00 (£22.50 for second claim) as do the session fees (see below):

- Sunday morning and Tuesday evening sessions:  £5.00 members (trial sessions also at £5 per session up to a maximum of three sessions)

- For the weekday morning sessions 

  - Early weekday morning sessions:  £5.00 per casual swim (pay as you swim) or 

  - £45 per month in advance/SO for 3 morning sessions each week per month

  - £33 per month in advance/SO any two mornings each week per month

  - £17 per month in advance/SO any one morning each week per month

Cheques are payable to Stroud Masters SC however if you wish to pay the membership fee directly into the Club bank account the details are as follows:

HSBC sort code 40-43-21 account number 21459090

Please let me know if/when you have done this.

If you have any queries please let me know. Could you also let me know if you don't intend to renew you membership,

Thanks & I hope you have a Happy New Year

Mark
