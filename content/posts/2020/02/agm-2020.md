Dear All,

Just a reminder that the swimming club AGM will be held on Monday 17th February at 18:30 at The Britannia Inn, Nailsworth. As in previous years some of those attending will be going for a curry afterwards. Everyone is welcome to attend.

Attached are the [Nomination form](/images/2020/02/nominations_2020.pdf) and [Agenda](/images/2020/02/agenda_2020.pdf). An updated copy of the consitution can be found [here](/images/2020/01/SMSC_Constitution_2020_Draft.pdf).

Regards

Jessica
