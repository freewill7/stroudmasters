Dear Swimmers,

The Local Answer has written a short article on Stroud Masters which you may find of interest. It is now published on their [website](https://www.thelocalanswer.co.uk/news/sport/swimming/2003-gsou-general-partridge-swimming.aspx?area=all) and in their booklets which can be found in various outlets in and around Stroud (Subscription Rooms / Library etc).

Regards

The Committee
