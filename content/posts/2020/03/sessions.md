Hello Everyone

Unfortunately following tonight's announcement by the Prime Minister we have cancelled all swimming sessions from immediate effect and for the foreseeable future. 

We know you will be hugely disappointed and frustrated however we have no option but to follow Government instructions. We will be in contact as soon as there is an update or some better news,

Regards

The Committee
