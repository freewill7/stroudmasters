Dear Members,
You may have already seen the guidance issued this week from Swim England …if not, it can been read [here](https://www.swimming.org/swimengland/pool-return-guidance-documents/).

The swimming fraternity is avidly waiting for the Government to confirm indoor public swimming pools in England can re-open. Today’s announcement (19/6/20) that England has reduced the Covid-19 risk level from ‘Four - a high or rising level of transmission - enforced social distancing’ to ‘Three - the virus is in general circulation - social distancing relaxed’ makes the Government’s pencilled in date of Saturday 4th July look even more promising.

Following a socially distanced meeting we can advise that, unless Government guidance changes in the interim, we are looking to re-open morning swimming at Archway on Monday 6th July. Archway are not offering other sessions until they have a better understanding of how things will work... so SMSC are literally testing the water... rest assured, following comprehensive risk assessments!

Whilst still abiding by social distancing rules, and the shielding of those that still need to, we initially plan to recommence the Monday, Wednesday and Friday morning sessions for club members who are current Archway morning swimmers i.e. had a Standing Order for morning swimming or swam at last once a week at Archway in the mornings. This will allow us to confirm the social distance measures put in place are adequate and workable, and where necessary, amend them. The following week we have agreed with Archway that we could open on Tuesday and Thursday mornings too, allowing all members, subject to appetite, and the booking system mentioned below, the opportunity of early morning swimming at Archway.

Each Archway morning session would cost £4 until we can return to more normal times. To control numbers attending we also plan to have a simple booking system, with swimmers committing to attend the booked session.

We have, today, contacted Stratford Park Leisure Centre regarding the 7:30-9:00am Sunday morning session and are awaiting a reply.

Once swimming reconvenes you will notice a few changes (covered in the afore mentioned Swim England guidance) that we will need to put in place to allow us to maintain social distancing, and these changes will be made known to you prior to returning to swimming. Swim England also requires you to agreeing to these changes until things return to what we knew as ‘normal’ and when hopefully they can be relaxed.

Below is a link to a questionnaire about whether you would be interested in the morning sessions at Archway whilst the Tuesday evening and Sunday morning sessions are on hold, and your fitness levels (so we can gauge the structure of sessions).

Kindest regards.

Your Committee
