Hello Everyone

As you will know we are looking at starting back at Archway pool on Monday 27th July. To start with the school will only allow us to use the pool on Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings between 6.30 - 7.30 am. 

Due to the ongoing requirement to maintain social distancing and the need to limit the number of swimmers in the pool to twelve we will only be able to operate with a pre-booking arrangement which hopefully will be able to accomodate everyone wishing to swim. If you are interested in swimming in any of the sessions above please reply to me (markpswim@gmail.com) by Friday 17th with the following information which will help finalise the booking system.

1. Which sessions listed above you would be interested in swimming in. 
1. How often would you be interested in swimming e.g. weekly, every other week, monthly etc. 
1. Can you make a regular commitment to swim - if so what is it? If not, let me know with what you may be able to commit to.
1. Any weeks you cannot make over the next 3 months e.g. away on holiday etc.

Just a reminder that there won't be a coach on poolside at any of the sessions. Also if you want to delay and try these sessions out at a later date let me know then.

Thanks for your help. I will be in touch asap after the 17th with the details,

Mark
