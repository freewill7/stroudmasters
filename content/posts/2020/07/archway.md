Hello Everyone

Yesterday we unfortunately received notification from Archway School that they won't in fact be opening up the pool until September at the earliest. As soon as we have a definite date for restarting training we'll let everyone know. I'm sorry for any inconvenience this has caused you.

In the meantime could anyone who has yet to complete the Return to swimming declaration and the Health survey please return these to Richard Searle asap so everything is in order prior to restarting.

If you have any queries please don't hesitate to get in contact.

Regards

Mark
