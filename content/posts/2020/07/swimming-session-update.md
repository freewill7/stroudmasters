Hello Everyone

Attached is a letter from the committee regarding the resumption of club swimming sessions. It's important that as pools begin to open up and sessions begin to restart (and if you want to swim with the club during the current Covid-19 situation) that you return the attached forms to Richard asap.

I have also attached Swim England’s ‘Advice for Returning to Exercise after Covid-19’ in case anyone has had Covid-19 it and isn’t sure what they should do.

If you have any queries please contact Richard or myself,

Regards

Mark
