Hello Everyone

The early morning sessions (6.30 to 7.30am) on Monday and Wednesday will resume at Archway from 21st September. We plan to keep the current SPLC session on a Friday morning (7.30 to 9.00 am) going as it stands at the moment until we get our normal Sunday slot back when we'll revert to three morning sessions at Archway. The SPLC session will remain on a rota basis however the Archway sessions won't be rota based unless we get a sudden surge of interest.

The cost for the Archway sessions are £5 payable after the session into the Club account or you can set up an SO (for the morning sessions only) at the previous rates i.e. 
- 3 sessions / week = £45 monthly, 
- 2 sessions / week = £33 monthly, 
- 1 session / week = £17 monthly. 

If you set an SO up can you let me know please.

As soon as I hear more about the resumption of sessions on a Tuesday evening I'll let you know. 

If you have any queries please get in contact

Regards

Mark
