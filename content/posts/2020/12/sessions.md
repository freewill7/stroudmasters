Hello

Just to confirm that we will be starting back on Friday at SPLC (7.30-9.00am) and on Monday at Archway (6.30-7.30am).

There will be two sessions per week at Archway (Monday and Wednesday) and one session per week at SPLC (Friday).

There may be some disruption to the Archway sessions in the New Year as they are planning a refurb. Will advise as soon as there is more news,

Mark
