Hello

Just to confirm that we will be starting back on Monday at Archway (6.30-7.30am). There will be two sessions per week (Mon and Wed) as before lockdown.

SPLC session will run on Fridays (7.30-9.00am).

There may be some disruption to the Archway sessions in the New Year as they are planning a refurb. Will advise as soon as there is more news,

Mark
