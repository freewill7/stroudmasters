Dear Swimmers,

With yesterday's announcement from the government that Gloucestershire has entered tier 4, there will unfortunately be no swimming club sessions for the foreseeable future. We will be in touch with an update once we are in a position to be able to do so.

Happy New Year to you all and stay safe

Jessica
