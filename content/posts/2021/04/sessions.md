Dear All,

There is finally some positive news and we are hoping that club sessions will be restarting from Monday 17th May. The following club sessions will be run from this date:

- Monday mornings - 06:30-07:30 at Archway
- Tuesday evenings - 18:30-20:00 at Archway
- Wednesday mornings - 06:30-07:30 at Archway
- Friday mornings - 07:30-09:00 at Stratford Park

Stratford Park are currently unable to offer the Sunday morning slot as they are not yet operating to their normal timetable. Once their timetable returns to normal the Stratford Park session will revert to Sunday mornings and the Friday session will move to Archway.

If you wish to attend any of the club sessions please ensure that you complete the Return to Swimming questionnaire link that has been e-mailed. You will not be able to swim unless you have completed the questionnaire online. Please read the questions carefully as not all of them can be answered by selecting no!

A further e-mail will be sent to confirm the start date for sessions once the government has given the go ahead for indoor adult group sports. We look forward to seeing you back in the pool.

Regards

The Committee
