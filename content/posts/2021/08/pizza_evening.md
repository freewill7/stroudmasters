Hello Everyone

If you are interested in joining us for a pizza or just a drink at Stroud Brewery next Thursday then come along around 7pm.

If you could let Richard Searle or myself know by Tuesday that would be great. Everyone is welcome, especially our new or newer members. 

Any queries let me know - have a great weekend,

Mark
