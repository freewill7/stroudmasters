Hello Everyone

Good news from SPLC - we are expecting to restart our regular Sunday morning slot at 7.30am at the beginning of October. Once I have a firm date from SPLC I'll let everyone know. This will mean though that the current Friday session will revert to Archway at 6.30am.

If you have any questions let me know,

Mark
