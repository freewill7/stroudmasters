Dear All,

The committee is pleased to inform everyone that from Sunday 3rd October the regular Sunday morning swim session at Stratford Park will resume. The session starts at 07:30 and finishes at 09:00.

Please note that we are no longer taking cash payment on poolside. Swimmers are requested to pay Â£5 per session into the club bank account (unless paying by standing order) with a note of the date of the session attended. 

In addition, for those who have not yet returned to the club since the Covid pandemic, please complete the mandatory form that has been e-mailed. This is required prior to attendance.

Friday morning sessions will revert to Archway Pool from 1st October at the usual time of 06:30 - 07:30.

Regards
