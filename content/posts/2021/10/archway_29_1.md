Hello Everyone

The sessions at Archway on 29th Oct and 1st Nov have been cancelled due to unavailability of lifeguards as Sean, Richard and Mark are all away competing in various competitions that weekend.

The Sunday morning session at Stratford Park is unaffected and will go ahead as normal,

Sorry for any inconvenience - if you have any queries let me know

Mark
