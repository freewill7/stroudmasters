Hello

I'm sorry to say that I've had to cancel tomorrow's session at Archway as our coach has tested positive for COVID and so is unavailable to coach.

Please assume all will be okay for next week unless I let you know otherwise,

If you have any queries please get in contact with me,

Regards

Mark
