Hello

The Club is offering the opportunity to all members to gain the NRASTC (National Rescue Award for Swimming Teachers and Coaches) qualification.

The training will be over two Sundays (25th Sep and 2nd Oct) and be for 6 hours on each day with the venue likely to be St Edward's School Cheltenham. The full cost of the course will be paid for by the Club.

A small number of people in the club hold the qualification already which enables us to swim without lifeguards at Archway pool in the morning and on Tuesday evenings. There will people from the club attending on the above dates either taking, renewing or gaining training hours for the qualification.

If you are interested and want to find out more please let me know. Alternatively see the RLSS web-site for more details.

Mark
