Hello Everyone

We are cancelling a couple of Archway morning sessions in August as we have no lifeguard cover. These are Wed 24th and Fri 26th August.

We are also going to have a two week break at Archway on Tuesday 23rd and Tuesday 30th August.

Sorry for any inconvenience. If you have any queries please get in touch,

Mark
