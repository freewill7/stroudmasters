Richard Percival and Kelly Young both took part at the British Transplant Games held in Leeds this July. This competition enables people who have received an organ transplant to get together to hear each other stories, celebrate life post-transplant and to compete in their hospital teams where they received their transplants.  Richard came away with 4 golds, and Kelly came away with 2 golds and 2 silvers. 

Kelly has set up a Just Giving Page to help her fundraising for the World Transplant Games in Perth, Australia in April 2023. If you feel you can support or are just interested in the background visit the link below
