Jessica, Mark and Sean all competed in the Swim England Masters National Championships at Sheffield last weekend. Star of the show from a Stroud point of view was Jessica who won gold in three events: the 400m and 1500m freestyle and the 200m butterfly, and also came away with a silver in the 400m Individual Medley. She was closely followed by Sean who won the 400 IM in his age-group as well as getting a memorable silver medal in the 200m butterfly. Markâ€™s best placings were sixth in the 50m breaststroke and ninth in the 100m breaststroke.
