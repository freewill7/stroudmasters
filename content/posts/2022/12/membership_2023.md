Hello Everyone

Please find attached the [Club membership form for 2023](/images/2022/12/membership_form_2023_v2.pdf). If you could complete and return to myself and pay the annual membership fee into the club account before the end of January that would be great.  If the membership form and fees are not received by the end of January then I'll assume that you do not wish to renew and your ASA registration will cease.

It is important that the membership form is fully completed and returned so we can keep our records up-to-date especially if your details or contact details have changed over the last year.

I'm pleased to say that the membership fee remains the same as previous years at £45.00 (£22.50 for second claim). Unfortunately though we have had to increase the swim session fee (to **£6**) as well as the SO payments. Over the last year the club has been impacted with significant increases in pool hire charges both at Archway and especially at Stratford Park which unfortunately we have had to pass on to members. We are not anticipating any further increases in the coming year but in the unlikely event that we do then we may have to reconsider the session fee part way through the year, as well as the annual membership fee for 2024. 

From January 2023:

Sunday morning and Tuesday evening sessions will now be **£6.00** for members with the three free trial sessions to potential new members still remaining in place.

For the weekday morning sessions 

- Early weekday morning sessions:  **£6.00** per casual swim (pay as you swim) or 
- **£55** per month in advance/SO for 3 morning sessions each week per month
- **£40** per month       "              "    any two mornings each week per month
- **£21** per month       "              "    any one morning each week per month

(Please dont pay any membership fees into the account until next Jan 2023.)

If you have any queries please let me know. Could you also let me know if you don't intend to renew your membership,

Back to normal swimming from **Wednesday 4th January**

Happy New Year 

Mark
