Hello

The committee recently decided that we'd like to offer everyone in the club the opportunity to take a free session at Archway, either on a Tuesday evening or on Monday, Wednesday or Friday morning.

This offer is open to everyone who doesn't normally attend these sessions.

There's no particular time limit but if you are interested please take it by the end of April.

If you have any queries please get in touch

Mark
