Hello Everyone

Just to advise that there will be no swimming next Sunday (Easter Sunday) at SPLC, but back to normal the week after.

Also, the early morning sessions at Archway on Good Friday and Easter Monday will start at 7.30am instead of 6.30am.

All other sessions are as normal. If you have any queries please get in touch,

Mark
