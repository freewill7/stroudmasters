There's a film being released in early March on Mercedes Gleitze 1920's  channel swim called Vindication Swim.  Filmed with a 1920's feel.

How about a club members trip to the cinema to watch it and linking your love of swimming and film?  Be good to grab a drink afterwards to discuss.

On in Swindon, and Longwell Green, Bristol.  Both pretty much both same distance from Stroud.

It's 8th, 9th and 10th March.  Richard favours Friday 8th
 
Film starts around 7pm.
