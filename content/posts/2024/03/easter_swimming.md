Hello Everyone

Just to let you know that there will be no swimming at Stratford Park on Easter Sunday. The session is cancelled.

Early morning swimming at Archway on Good Friday and Bank Holiday Monday will start an hour later than normal at 7.30am, so if you are up for it come along and try it out,

If you have any queries please get in touch,

Mark
