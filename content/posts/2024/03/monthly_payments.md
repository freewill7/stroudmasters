Hello Everyone

The committee decided at the last meeting to extend the monthly payment option to cover all swimming sessions and not just Archway mornings.

The monthly payment options from 1st April are now as follows

- £55 - 3 swims a week
- £40 - 2 swims a week
- £21 - 1 swim a week

Monthly payments should be paid within the first 7 days of the month to qualify. If they are paid later the fee will revert to £6 per session for the whole month. Any swims above the number of those paid for per week will be charged at £6 per swim. It is also not possible to carry over unused swims from one month to the next.

If you pay monthly already please don't change your payment date if you fall outside of the first 7 days of the month (unless you want to).

I hope that all makes sense - if you have any queries please get in touch,

Regards

Mark
