Hello Everyone

For those of you not already aware, the pool at Archway will be closed from today until at least the end of August whilst they replace the whole plant filtration system. This will hopefully be a blessing in disguise with a much better pool swimming experience at the end of it.

Please cancel any SOs you have for Archway. 

I'll update everyone when we have more news about progress and completion.
