Hello

The committee has some good news regarding Tuesday evening swimming. You'll be pleased to know that Alice (Pinney) has volunteered to coach regularly on a Tuesday evening. She is a level 1 coach, likes teaching technique, and is keen to help the club out which means that we can start the Tuesday session as normal again from 1st October. (You might know Alice from the morning sessions). We aren't in a position to start back any earlier due to Alice's other commitments in September.

Alice is not yet qualified as a lifeguard, so will be supported by both Richard Searle and Richard Percival until she can get her qualification which hopefully will be in mid October.

We are going to run the session for three months and reassess again at the end of the year. It's vitally important that this session is well supported each week otherwise it may be at risk again. To give you an idea we'd be looking for at least eight or nine swimmers in each session to cover pool costs. 

We'd also like a volunteer from the Tuesday evening regulars to train up to cover lifeguard duties on any occasion that Alice can't make it and someone else steps in, otherwise the session may be cancelled. If anyone is interested please contact me and I can explain what is involved.

If anyone has any queries on the above please get in touch.

See you there

Mark
