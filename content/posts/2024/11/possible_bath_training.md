Hello Everyone

We are looking at the possibility of hiring one or two lanes at Bath Universitiy's 50m pool in January and would like to gauge interest from club members.

The session would be on a Saturday, and be for 60 or 90 minutes depending on availability of the pool and a coach,

Please could you respond to myself and Mike if you are interested,

Mark
