Hello Everyone

The Committee has decided to raise the membership fee this year by £5 to £50 due to recent increases in the pool hire costs and Swim England fees. Second claim members will receive a 50% discount and pay £25. In previous years we have managed to absorb the increase in costs within the membership fee but this is no longer possible. 

I'm pleased to be able to say though that swim fees will remain the same as last year @ £6 per swim. 

Please pay the annual membership fee into the club account after 1st January but no later than the 31st January. If the membership fee is not received by then I'll assume you do not wish to renew and your Swim England registration will cease.

I've attached the Club membership form for 2025 (see [About](/about) ).  You will notice that it has a slightly different format to previous years and it's important that everyone completes the form and returns to Lorraine (email above) when paying the membership.

We're not anticipating any further increases in swim session costs during the coming year but in the unlikely event there are then we may have to reconsider the session fee part way through the year, as well as the annual membership fee for 2026. 

From January 2025:

- £6.00 per casual swim (pay as you swim) or 

OR

- £55 per month in advance/SO for any three sessions each week per month
- £40 per month       "              "    any two sessions each week per month
- £21 per month       "              "    any one session each week per month

New members will be entitled to one trial swim at a cost of £6.

All swimmers will be registered as Club Train except for those who competed for the Club last year, who will be registered as Club Compete. If you are interested in competing for the Club please get in touch with either myself or Lorraine and we can set you up as Club Compete in a few days, prior to entry.

If you have any queries please let me know. Could you also let me know if you don't intend to renew your membership,

Regards

Mark
