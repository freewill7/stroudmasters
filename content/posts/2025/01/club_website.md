Hello Everyone

As you may be aware, Will Lee is leaving the club this month and we're now on the lookout for a volunteer to help manage and update the club website.

Maintaining the existing website requires someone with a bit of a technical background, who is:
- Confident with managing files in a directory structure
- Happy running programs from a command line
- Comfortable with markdown
- Able to volunteer 1-2 hours each month for website maintenance (e.g. maybe 15 minutes per week)

This would include the updating of club news and policy documents from time to time as well as the updating of information that rarely changes such as fees, timetables, calendars, records etc. At this point we are not looking to redesign the website or plan any major changes to the website structure.

If you are interested in supporting the club in this way (or might be), please get in touch asap. If you have a family member who might be interested please also get in touch.

Or if you just have a query or want to find out more just let me know,

Regards

Mark
