Dear all,

New club kit with the new logo is now available to order! Click on the link below:

[https://stroudmasters.deco-apparel.com](https://stroudmasters.deco-apparel.com)

For this first run, we only have the competition colours (red), as the race season is starting, and these are our club colours for poolside. 

When you make your order, please note the following:

#### Shipping Methods
- ⁠a member of the committee will do one bulk collection from the printers, if you complete your order by 15th February 2025 and you have selected ‘Customer Collection: £0’ in the section Select Shipping Method’;
- ⁠alternatively, you can select the other options if you’d prefer; 
- ⁠technical t-shirts are on the smaller side. So go up one size when ordering;

#### Order Options
- leave ‘Customer PO Number’ blank;
- ⁠‘Add Instructions’ - add, "Will be collected as part of bulk order by Stroud Masters in February"
- ⁠you cannot amend ‘Job Name’

#### Other Colour Options
We appreciate that members may wish to order kit but not the club colours. We are planning other orders with a wider range of colours and hope to provide this once we have completed the first order..

#### On sizing 
*please note* - sizes are based on chest sizing. This will be displayed if you tap/click in the size option and then scroll down. However there is currently no sizing information for the technical t-shirts. We have asked the printers to add (just a reminder that tech shirts are on the smaller size so go up a size).

If you have any issues with the order, please contact Mike Joffe.

The Committee
