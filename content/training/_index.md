Training plans for previous sessions can be found [here](/training/session-plans).

<!--
Due to Gloucestershire entering tier 4 (31 December 2020) there are no swimming sessions for the foreseeable future. We will be updating the website and contacting members when we are in a position to resume sessions.
-->

As of 17th May 2021, times of sessions are:

|Day|Time|Location|

During holiday periods sessions may be cancelled or timings changed. Members will be informed by e-mail and reminders posted on the Club Website. It is important that Club members provide an up to date email address to ensure they receive the latest news and information from the Club.

Club members pay £5 per session for all sessions.

Monday, Wednesday and Friday Mornings (Archway) Morning sessions:
---

|||
|---|---|
|Occasional swim|£5 per session|
|1 session per week|£17 per month|
|2 sessions per week|£33 per month (usually 8-9 swims)|
|3 sessions per week|£45 per month (usually 12-13 swims)|

1. Early weekday morning sessions are payable by Standing Order/cash (see Treasurer for details). The monthly morning swimming payment entitles the member to either 1, 2 or 3 sessions in any one week (Mon – Fri).  Unfortunately, due to the costs of pool hire, missed sessions cannot be carried forward to the following week and no refunds can be made. Swimmers wishing to change their morning session attendance should advise the Treasurer before amending/cancelling their Standing Orders.
2. It is the individual swimmer’s responsibility to amend/cancel their Standing Order where applicable. If no payments are received at the beginning of each month then casual swim fees will apply.
